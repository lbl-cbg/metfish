CoDNaS Auto Processing

Description:
CoDNaS is a database comparing diverse conformation of the identical proteins.
It provides a good interface for pairwise comparison but lack of useful APIs especially for downloading files.

The best approach for now is to manually download a tsv file containing the PDB ID of all conformers for a single protein.
Thus, this script is used to automatically download the PDB from RCSB based on the list and then covert them to SAXS curve and P(r) curve with FOXS and RAW APIs.

Problems:
1.FOXS will add the hydration layer to the PDB and then calculated the SAXS curve. This may eliminate some difference between conformations
2.Each PDB may contain multiple conformers which is similar to each other. I am trying to extract them and generate individual SAXS curve which is still under testing. 

Files:
1BZF_A.hclusterRMSD.txt - raw data downloaded from CoDNaS database
full_clean.sh - main script
batch_download_seq_new.sh - modified RCSB script to download PDB and sequence files
SAXS_to_pr.py - convert the PDB file to SAXS and P(r)

Dependency: 
Anaconda -
Request python library -
RAW API -
FOXS -

Usage:
bash full_clean.sh
-f <file>: the input file containing a list of pdb files downloaded from CoDNaS
-o  <dir>: the output dir

Example
mkdir test
bash full_clean.sh -f ./1BZF_A.hclusterRMSD.txt -o ./test

The script will create 4 folders ./test/pdb ./test/sequence ./test/saxs_q (raw SAXS) ./test/saxs_r (P(r) in csv)
